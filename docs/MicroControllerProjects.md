## **Diode Heartrate Monitor (Feb. 2022 - March 2022)**

This first video shows a similar project of a temperature monitor using similar principles, based on the same code but with different hardware setups.

The circuit works by using the op-amp to amplify the weak signal emitted from the light passing through the tissue containing blood. 
Then this information is processed using the microcontroller circuit and 2 codes to generate a heart rate monitor.

    ```

- Developed AT89LP51RC2 micro-controller based photoelectric heart rate monitor
- Wrote software that would read micro-controller using PuTTY and C
- Further graphed data with Python using MatLab functions to graph heart rate

    ```

- Built a software based AC voltmeter using C
- Understood AC circuit concepts to create voltmeter that determined magnitude, phase shift, and phase of AC signals produced by function generator
