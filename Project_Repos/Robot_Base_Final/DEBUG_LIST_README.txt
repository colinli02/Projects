Perimeter detector
	Couldnt detect change 
	No output out of op amp
	ADC reads 3.3 V out of diode output (~0.7 expected
	
	
	ADCtest is gibberish? 
	== Make sure VCC and GND are 3.3V railing 

Coin detector
	Frequency fluctuation, changes every time we restart (frequency main)

Electromagnet
	Electromagnet does not turn on 
	Microcontroller outputs 3.3v correctly at right time 
	Opto - 6v connection loses 2v (batteries are fine) 
	Microcontroller works but output to circuit stuck at 2v

Voltage ranges post op amp



if putty slow
check GND pins (e.g. adctest perim double op amp)
